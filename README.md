# Next.js

This is my implementation of the [getting started guide](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started).

## Notes

- The only special directories are `/pages` and `/public`.
- Uses `styled-jsx` CSS in JS framework. Styles are scoped to the components they are attached to, not even child components.

```shell
npm install -g npm-check-updates
ncu
```
